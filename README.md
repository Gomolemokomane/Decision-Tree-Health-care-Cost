# Decision-Tree-Health-care-Cost
## Project Overview 
Healthcare costs continuously rise globally, with an increasing burden on healthcare systems, the need to manage resources efficiently while ensuring high-quality patient care as become of importance and to do this, we need to understand the factors that contribute to high healthcare costs
## Objective 
The objective of the Project is to develop a predictive model that classifies patients into high or low healthcare cost based on attributes. 
This classification helps healthcare providers and health insurance providers to correctly identify which patients are most likely to incur higher costs and thereby provide a more targeted allocation of resources and treatment plans. By making use of historical data on patient demographics, health conditions, and utilization patterns, we can build a decision tree model that can assist in identifying high-cost patient.
In health care decision trees are advantageous because of their interpretability and ability to handle categorical and numeral data with the need to extensively preprocess making it perfect for large and diverse datasets, One can easily understand how factors influence each other
